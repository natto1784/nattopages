* Alo
My name is Amneesh Singh but I also go as natto (or natto1784) online. I was born in the blazing hot summer of 2003 in India, where I also currently reside (just in a different region). I am currently a freshman in college studying engineering. My major is Information Technology. I struggle with basic tasks but I can barely help that.

I like a lot of things but currently I am into Emacs and functional programming. I also enjoy listening to Trivium. But the thing that I like the most is sleeping, I really do sleep a lot.

I dislike particularly nothing
