* Alo
My name is Amneesh Singh but I also go as natto (or natto1784) online. I was born in the blazing hot summer of 2003 in India, where I also currently reside (just in a different region). I am currently a freshman in college studying engineering. My major is Information Technology. I struggle with basic tasks but I can barely help that.

I like a lot of things, however I am on a long break from IT tinkering and programming and am into Lacan's PA at the moment.

I dislike particularly nothing.
