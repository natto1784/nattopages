I have decided to stop running HashiStack. As some of you might know, I only run a RaspberryPi4B for a server for power related reasons and lack of old cheap server hardware. It is not the best hardware to orchestrate containers on, especially when it already has NixOS installed. I do not use extravagant software and my setup from earlier this year was very overkill. I recently stopped using CI at all since I realised I do not really need it. This post is about similar feelings. I have spent a shit ton of time learning HashiStack this year and have decided to stop using it altogether in some time. 

I just hope I will not regret wasting my time learning stuff that I am never going to use and will save me some headache in the future as well. Being a hobbyist is tough.

EDIT 1: Man I do not know what to do, they do not take much resources (except Vault), but I can run Gitea and other small stuff on NixOS as services instead anyway, I do not see any point in running Nomad except when I need to spin up containers. I don't know man. I don't know.
