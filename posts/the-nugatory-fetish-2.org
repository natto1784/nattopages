Exhausted and jaded, now more than ever, Lyngdoh took the bus back home, to the Western outskirts of Bhikan, also known as the 'Immigrant Central'. It was crammed with hippies and vagrants, and bottom feeders of all sorts. Not a surprise, given the time; another three hours and it will be a brand new day. Nevertheless, he still somehow reached his matchbox of an apartment, fit for a bachelor his age. It was raining, perfect weather for a drink or two, but as it happens, Lyngdoh did not drink. The first and the last time he got drunk was with his then friends, on his brother's wedding day, truly an occasion worth celebrating. As soon as he rested his hands on the door handle, he heard a yell, but could not comprehend it. It came from the bottom of the staircase leading to his door, consequently he looked in that direction tardily. There stood the tenant who lived below his room, but as it happens, Lyngdoh could not remember his name but outright ignoring him would not exactly be polite either. The only thing on his mind now was that he definitely could not afford to miss out on his daily six hours of sleep.

"Hey, you free? Want to join?" The neighbor stood there, slightly intoxicated, waving a half-empty Kissan bottle at Lyngdoh. He wore an unbuttoned black suit with a stained white shirt and some generic leather shoes, ironically resembling what a law attorney would look like in the court. But there was no way that they shared the same profession, Lyngdoh would not have missed it if that was true.

Lyngdoh was inexplicably tired, and thus could not just yell back without frowning. The creaks of the staircase soon joined the crickets. He took a deep breath and started throwing up words in quick succession - "I respect the offer and thank you for it; however, today was a harsh day and a bed is all I crave right now." Lyngdoh intentionally rubbed his forehead while talking, emphasizing the feelings behind his words even further.

"Bullshit! You even came all the way down here, you know that you want it, don't pretend like you don't." The neighbor cried out in response, almost hitting that bottle on the staircase railing in the process. Lyngdoh could not just outright be honest and tell him that he did not drink and needed his six hours of daily sleep, as obviously, it would be seen as a rude gesture in these parts where people struggle to make the ends meet.

"Okay, how about a game?" As Lyngdoh was trying to come up with the perfect excuse, the neighbor snapped him back to reality.

"Sorry? I am afraid a game is not enough to tempt me." Lyngdoh replied in a sorry, yet dignified voice.

"Nyet, you got it all wrong, I am not inviting you to a game. I am asking you to play a game that decides whether you join me or not." A smug face would go along with such a cheesy invitation but the guy was dead serious, probably about to cry. Lyngdoh wanted to ask him "Why should I?", but did not want to start an ideological debate with him at the same time; he was not a student anymore and therefore, asked him what really mattered.

"What game? Something involving cards?" Lyngdoh asked, making the obvious guess.

"Bingo. Here's a deck, you go blind a choose a card. Draw a king and you stay." The guy almost started sounding sober all of a sudden. He held a soft, dampened, yet not wet, deck of cards, probably used a good amount of times. The game favored Lyngdoh heavily and was a good way to get out of this stalemate. There was absolutely no reason for him to decline the offer and he made the obvious decision of taking it.
He shoved the deck into Lyngdoh's chest. The latter picked out a card without looking at the deck as it would require sharp neck movement which his tired body was incapable of right now. He seemingly woke up from his half-sleepy state as he held that card right to his face. It was the king of diamonds. What luck!

Lyngdoh was now frustrated once again, the second time this evening. "Why does this always happen to me", he thought while still staring at the king, "Dutt and now him, lady luck has truly abandoned me." There were no ladies or anything so pleasant involved, it was all but a king. The king smiled down from his throne at this peasant clown who had lost all hope.

"Ha! There you go, I win, you stay." The author of these words was overjoyed at his victory. Upon noticing Lyngdoh's pitiable expression he lashed out at him. "Come on, you lost, don't be such a child, learn to let loose once in a while. You are not the only busy person in this world, we are all struggling here, okay? Now come, join me, let's throw our woes at each other and be men who help each other out." He gave a weak attempt at smiling and arguably failed.

It did not matter what Lyngdoh wanted now, he cannot wriggle his way out of this now, it is too late. The carrier, the battleship, the destroyer, the submarine and the boat have all been shot and dealt with, there is no escaping this nightmare now. All he could do now was stay true to his character and once again, justify the time that he is about to waste. "It is not too bad to relax, I have been busy for months now, it is only natural to let loose," Lyngdoh told himself. He would have rated this attempt at consolation pretty badly but anything works now, he was too tired to think rationally.

He went into the man's apartment as the latter held the door, and helped himself to the sofa. The floor layout was the same as his and etiquettes were a no-go in this poor man's suburb, so he did not need his permission to sit, especially after he was practically begged into doing this. The man went from closing the door to pouring in Lyngdoh's glass instantaneously, or more accurately, his assigned glass, as the latter was still contemplating his choices for the day.

"So, what bothers you today, my friend?" The man asked reluctantly, folding his hands, probably roleplaying as a therapist. Lyngdoh was snapped back from the, oh so meaningful abyss to reality.

"Huh, what bothers me? You were the one who invited me here against my wishes. Should you not be the one to talk about what distresses you? I thought you just wanted an ear." He spoke, not so much angry as confused now. He picked up his glass and took a meager sip but his expression failed to change; he was successfully duped into doing what the person wanted and was an active part of the conversation now.

"You are not wrong, I indeed wanted to rant about practically everything but that can wait, you seem more annoyed and perplexed than me; and something tells me, I am not the sole reason for that." The man was grinning, but was back to his relaxed, drunken state, probably on purpose, as part of his roleplay as a therapist; ergo pretending to be a serious listener, he put down his glass.

"You are not wrong either, you're not as dumb as you look. Either way, it is of little importance, I am already over it. More importantly, what happened to you, what got you into this severe state of needing a drinking partner? And why me? If I can recall correctly, you have been living here for almost two months shy of an annum, and not once have we talked outside greeting each other; what happened to your usual friends? If you allow me to be honest, I do not even remember your name."Lyngdoh spoke, still sober, but with an almost empty glass now. This was his mixed attempt at annoying his neighbor back and sating his curiosity. He has thrown away all his desire for having a purpose for the mere sake of having a break from everything.
